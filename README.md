## Usage

Clone the repo and make sure to use the `--recursive` option. If you dont have git you can download a zip of the repo in releases.

Make sure to change the project name on the `CMakeLists.txt` file
```cmake
set(PROJECT_NAME template-project) # change this
```

To build this project you'll need CMake, which you can download [here](https://cmake.org/download/), and a C++ compiler, such as MSVC, which you can get with Visual Studio

**Make sure you're building in 32 bit mode**, as gd (atleast the windows version) is 32 bit, meaning your dll has to be too.

All the source files contain a lot of comments which you should definitely read if you're just starting out :) (i recommend starting from [dllmain.cpp](https://github.com/matcool/gd-mod-example/blob/master/src/dllmain.cpp))
